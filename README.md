# iOS-Apps
All apps are fully functional unless otherwise stated. All apps were developed for personal learning purposes, 
but are certainly open to changes! :] Also, if the language is not stated, all apps are written in Objective-C.

**Apps included:**
==================
**Alogorhytm**: Simple master detail app that consists of 4 different playlists in the master view and a list of hardcoded songs in the detail view.

**BlogReader**: Table view app that uses parses JSON data from a hardcoded blog and presents their vital statistics in a list of cells. CLicking a cell will open that blog's link in safari.

**Diary**: Diary app that utilizes Core Data to create diary entries in an organized table view. Entries are ordered by creation date and sectioned off by months. Each entry the user creates contain: the user's current location, the date, a mood the user chooses, and a 200-word limit text entry.

**Fun Facts**: Very simple app that contains a bunch of facts and colors that are randomly displayed when the user clicks a button.

**iOS Networking**: A series of apps that aided me in learning how to network with iOS (parse JSON, create HTTP requests, etc). Project sketons were downloaded from Udacity.com.

**On The Map** (SWIFT) : Map-based app that that uses the Udacity and Parse APIs to retrieve information on a database of Udacity students. The user can authentitcate with Udacity or log in with Facebook to access the app. While in the app, the user is able to search for a location on Apple's map and place a pin along with an annotation. If this annotation's subtitle contains a link, the app will open the link in safari. The student and user's pins are presented in two tabs: a map view with pins, or a table view of annotations. 

**Photo Bombers/Hashtagger**: An instagram-based app that uses a collection view to present rows of search photos retrieved from Instagrams API. Users search for photos by specifying a hashtag on the first page of the app and photos will be retrieved. After pulling up a list of photos, users can either long-tap them directly to like them or tap normally to pull a detailed metadata view of the photo. Clicking on the metadata(likes, comments, username) will transfer the user to either the photo's respective page or owner's page.

**Pitch Perfect**(SWIFT): Simple voice recording app that allows a user's voice to modified with a couple of filters once recorded.

**Snapshat**: Mock Snapchat app that allows users to take timed photos to send to other users if they are friends. Users have the option to take a photo with their phone's camera or choose one from their camera roll. Once a user clicks on a photo/video from another user, the photo/video is displayed for 10 seconds until it self deletes. The photos/videos, user relationships and account information are all stored on Parse.com to be used in the app. Users have to sign up and/or log in with the app in order to use it. For Android only: push notifications are also sent when a user recieves a message (photo/video) from another user
